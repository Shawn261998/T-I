              <h3>Functions: Inception Point</h3>
              <p>In my capstone project, I identified a problemâ€”whether in my own life or in the lives of others. I then designed and implemented my answer to this problem, utilizing the tools, technologies, and techniques I've learned in this class.</p>

              <h3>Links: Physical Touchpoints</h3>
              <p>In this project, I applied learned skills to create a media-based project, connecting content, tools, and form. I utilized JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS to dynamically render and manipulate pages, ensuring responsiveness and facilitating interaction with the collection.</p>

              <h3>Binding: The Sifting Canvas</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was to apply the skills I had developed across multiple web pages, creating my first website. This "book" included a homepage (its cover), navigation (table of contents), individual pages for each text (chapters), and my introduction (a colophon). It housed my texts and allowed a reader to move between them all.</p>

              <h3>Spreads: Graphic Design Bias</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was twofold: achieving a successful responsive design and fostering effective collaboration between partners. Each duo sketched cooperatively and then implemented a joint execution together via pair programming. The final web page was responsive for mobile, desktop, and print layouts.</p>

              <h3>Manuscript: Design Education</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was to refine basic skills in typography, focusing on expression, hierarchy, and appropriate form for a work. This was achieved through exploration, trial and error, and responding to critical feedback. Subsequently, this typesetting was executed in code, manifesting as a web page.</p>
